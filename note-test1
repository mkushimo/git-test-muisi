I am a child of God and my steps are ordered by the Lord
I am a child of God and I am daily led by His word
I am a child of God and His Spirit dwells in me to lead and guide me
I am a child of God and He daily leads me by the still waters
I am a child of God and I do not conform to worldly ways
I am a child of God and I daily renew my mind with Hi word!
I am a child of God and I walk in His perfect and acceptable will for my life!
I am a child of God and I am blessed cause I obey Him in all my ways!
Glory! Hallelujah!
Mercy will speak for us as a home.
Grace will abound roundabout
